mpv-0.30.0 release from https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv (12-22-2019)

To build for Debian buster-backports, after all dependencies,
 i.e., ffmpeg, libjack-jackd2-dev instead of libjack-dev in debian/control,
 etc., were fulfilled:

Already executed ./bootstrap.py
(to download waf)

All the patches have been applied, as well, with command:
quilt push -a --fuzz=0

However, I renamed the debian/patches provided waf
 and utilized waf generated by bootstrap.py (see above).

Simply build with command:

dpkg-buildpackage -F -us -uc -jX -T binary-arch,binary-indep
(where X above stands for number of CPU cores assigned to the task)


Huelmati [Enjoy]!
